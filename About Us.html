                        <p>Sorella means "sister" in Italian, and it's two sisters who are the creative minds behind this growing business. Hannah Roberts and Kelly Ashton started designing wedding arrangements as their own business in 2010, working out of their parents' garage in Henniker, NH. Their creativity and dedication to providing exceptionally beautiful and unique flower arrangements quickly earned Sorella an exemplary reputation, and the business grew quickly. In 2013, Hannah continued with the business and renovated a store-front location in quaint Contoocook, NH, where they offered beautiful, seasonal (and local, when possible) fresh-cut flowers. In 2017 she closed the store-front to become a floral studio. To focus on thing that she loved the most..weddings! Now she can devote her time to beautifying weddings and events.</p>
